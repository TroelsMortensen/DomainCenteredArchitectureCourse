# Domain Centered Architecture

This is an elective course available at VIA University College, Horsens, Denmark, for Software Technology Engineering students.

## Course Overview
The course focuses on various approaches to organize an application. We will throughout the course develop a Web Service, but the theories can be applied to all kinds of systems.

We will introduce:
* Domain Driven Development (DDD)
* Test/Behaviour Driven Development (TDD/BDD)
* Various architectural styles
* Various architectural patterns

The course theories will be applied to create a complete Web Service. Each week a new topic will be introduced and then applied to the course-spanning project. We will apply a "big-bang" development approach (inside-out when considering hexagonal, onion, clean), due to the nature of the course, and the order of the topics.
