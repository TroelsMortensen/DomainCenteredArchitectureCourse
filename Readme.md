# Domain Centered Architecture

This is an elective course available at VIA University College, Horsens, Denmark, for Software Technology Engineering students.

## Course Overview
The course focuses on various approaches to organize an application. We will focus on a Web Service, but the theories can be applied to all kinds of systems.

We will introduce:
* Domain Driven Development (DDD)
* Test/Behaviour Driven Development
* Various architectural styles
* Various architectural patterns

The course theories will be applied to create a complete Web Service. Each week a new topic will be introduced and then applied to the course-spanning project.

## Sources
This course has been developed based on a considerable collection of various sources, e.g. books, articles, videos.


Below I have attempted to collect all of it in one large collection. Each session will also include sources relevant to that session.\
